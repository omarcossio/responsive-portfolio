# responsive-portfolio

This is an updated porfotio for myself, Omar Cossio. It was created using Bootstrap as a CSS framework, and contains some of my projects. 

This portfolio contains an about me section, portfolio section, and a contact section. 

The portfolio tab, includes demo photos of each project. Each photo is a clickable link to the deployed live version and the title is a link to the github repository for each project. 

Since Bootstrap was the CSS framework, the page is responsive.
